I guess I should start by introducing myself. I’m Opoku, Nana Addo Opoku. I’m currently 20 and I know it’s not an old age but in my mind it screams as old as Methuselah because I recently went through an experience where I was making some references to some kid shows I used to watch to some children and apparently they had never(NEVER) heard of them. Either these kids are not loved by their parents or they haven’t seen a television. This experience has lead me to the conclusion that I am now Methuselah.

The main reason why I’m writing this blog is because I want to get into the habit of doing something productive 

Secondly someone suggested I do this, at first I laughed at the idea of me writing a blog because I wasn’t that much of a reader, even when it was a compulsory book that I had to read for my exams, and now I’m going to write a blog... smh. Either this could go completely wrong or I may low key be the next J.K Rowling (P.S I’m rooting for this option; my parents are definitely…definitely rooting for this option too)

Also, I’ll like to see how I develop through this from either my work ethic or see if It will be easier for me to convey what is actually going on in my head. I once heard on a podcast (yep I listen to podcast…I’m old like that) that “Writing is the fastest way to improve upon your thinking”

Plus, I get to see how my mindset will change over the years. Cross my fingers, toes and everything else and hope for the best.
