# **Lessons from my gap year(s)**


### - Know Yourself 

  Now if the is only one thing only one lesson that I have learnt from this whole gap year(s) experience it will be “know yourself”. If I was to advice any soul on God’s green earth to take a gap year it will be for this one point and I’m not just saying that because I like that one Drake song know yourself (which by the way you should listen to it…. it’s pure fire) but during this whole gap year(s) experience I have learnt so much about myself, things that I may had never noticed about myself or things that I knew but may had forgotten about and I’m so glad that I they have come to my attention at this stage of my life and not later. I once heard this saying that “in life we spend a lot of time trying to get to know others which is really important but the one person we should get to know the most is ourselves.”

### - The Devil Finds work for Ideal hands

   I’m sure you might have heard this saying before and not really taught much about it (well me) but I have learnt that this is very true (so true). Normally when you are in school or have an obligation you usually have things to fill up your time with, whether its class or extracurricular activities or homework or even mingling with people in school. Usually all these activities drains your energy by the end of the day, not leaving you with much time to kill but then here comes my gap year(s) and the is no teacher given me any work to do basically I’m in charge of my whole day and it leaves this gap in my life (the irony). I suddenly have all this extra time in my day to basically kill and now here comes the devil who has been basically waiting for this opportunity his whole life who would have taught the devil doesn’t take a gap year.

### - Doing nothing is overrated

 For years upon years to be honest since I can remember I haven’t really liked school. I was always that guy, the one who stares at the clock or kept asking for the time just to know how many more hours in the day were needed for me to fake paying attention (can I just say I deserve an Oscar). It was always the scenario where I couldn’t wait to go home. To do what you may ask, I liked to think of it us the purpose of life. Which was basically not be in school because it was boring (so boring) .I’ll rather spend an entire day  watching news about how goats communicate with trees or even form faces out of objects than rather go to school (I feel like I need to add that I wasn’t a bad student, I just didn’t really like school) and after spending months away from that place not necessarily school but being productive in a sense It has finally dawned on me that doing nothing is over-rated (better late than never, I guess). That’s one of the reasons for this blog, to become a productive person (and can I just say it feels so ... so good). Who would have taught that in order for me to want to become a productive member of society I would have to reach the lowest stage of laziness.

### * The Grass isn’t always greener on the other side

  I remember when I was in boarding school (a.k.a prison) I used to say at least once in a day….at least that I couldn’t wait to get out of boarding school because It’s just another word for prison but the only difference is that……is that…. Well basically the difference was nil (don’t quote me on that one I haven’t been to prison) and the real world was outside does four walls. I honestly almost cried when it was all finally done. I had all these plans on what I was going to do, which was basically nothing (absolutely nothing). During this gap year(s) I have lived the dream by that I mean I have spent an entire day, week even a month playing video game or watching every TV show I could possibly find till my eyes literally started to hurt and at the end of the day (drum roll please) I got bored, no joke I actually got bored ladies and gentlemen from doing nothing. I honestly couldn’t believe it, I still can’t believe it. I got to a stage where I had no interest to even watch game of thrones (GAME OF THRONES) us I write this I have hard drives filled to the brim with movies and series that even little boys would think that I’m actually a cool person and I have no interest in watching them. Honestly, I don’t know if this is a mid-life crisis or something but I got bored. If time travel was a thing and my ten year old self found out I was writing this, my face would get smashed to my keykhjdskb hcv jhhgj .  


### * Your Environment will influence you

  Who you surround yourself with is who you become. “Show me your friend and I’ll show you your character” this is a popular saying where I’m from or you may be familiar with “You are the sum of your five closes friends”. In other words If your friends are funny odds are you will end up become funny too or if they have bad habits odds are you will develop bad habits too. Their character turns to rob of on us.

### * Garbage in garbage out

 What you consume most will show outward. Whether it’s what you are eating, what you watch or listen to etc. I have learnt that the brain is like a sponge it soaks up all this information and slowly but surely what you soak in will build your character and your attitude. 

### * Exercise(or even just going for a simple walk) 

 Since the was no school in my life during my gap year(s) it also meant no Physical Education (P.E) nobody forcing me to chase a ball or even to go outside and do something active. What I soon came to realize was that human beings weren’t designed to do nothing. I can remember a point where I really wasn’t enjoying anything. I just felt tired all the time and unmotivated. And on one random day my parents decide they wanted to go for a walk because their doctors advised them to do and I tagged along because yolo (I’m sorry I just said that, the will be no more yolo’s). This simple activity genuinely changed my mood drastically. I don’t really know what the science is behind exercising but something that I have learnt is that for an activity that is supposed to drain your energy, at the end of the day makes you feel much more energetic and happy about life overall. 

### * The Power of the internet 

 What a time to be alive (another Drake reference): And I say this because of something called the Internet (I’m sure you have heard of it) it’s filled with so much useful information. I feel like we should change the word from internet to bae because it’s actually bae for most of us :( There is so much you can do with it and learn from it, just because you aren’t in school doesn’t mean you can’t learn.  There are so many tutorials on websites such as YouTube on anything you want for example: how to start a blog, make a chair or even how to drink water. Some websites are even dedicated to completely teaching people educational courses for a degree for example: Udemy, Lynda, Edx, Treehouse, Code.org etc. The internet is so much more than a social networking platform.


### * Relationships

 At the beginning of my gap year I really didn’t make it an effort to contact people. I was just meh (neutral) about the whole situation and as time progressed I have come to realize that in life relationships matter (Nobody wants to be old and have only imaginary friends in their life unless you are like the antichrist or something). A gap year(s) can get quite lonely?. It took me a while to get there but I realized why Adam felt lonely in the Garden of Eden and I’m not comparing myself to Adam by no means but the struggle is real my friends. Even though 70% of the time we want to kill each other, having people around doesn’t seem that bad after creating a couple of imaginary friends here and there. What I have come to realize from this experience is that relationships are like seeds you should spend time on them if you want them to grow or exist. Spending this time off has taught me that it doesn’t hurt to take a minute out of your day to find out how someone else is doing. It could make their day or even make yours.

### * Which leads me to my next point

It’s the little things in life: Let me tell you something, when you aren’t in school or socializing that much after a while your inbox will be drier than the Sahara Dessert, sometimes the only message you could get in a day will be from your mobile service providers asking you if this line is still in use. During this time off I have come to realize that in life the little things can mean so much. For example during this gap year(s) I can remember some days getting calls or even a text from people I haven’t seen in a while randomly and it just makes my day (yes people, I have actually reached a stage in my life where a simple text message can put a huge smile on my face, it doesn’t even matter if it’s just two words “Hi”). It wasn’t also necessarily the message itself but the mere fact that you were on someone’s mind. They were somewhere living their life and just had a random taught to themselves that - ooh hey let me find out how Nana Addo is doing - which just warms my heart.

_**Pheeeew now that we are done with the mushy gushy stuff lets continue**_

### * Your Value in life shouldn’t come from the way people treat you

 I know it sounds us if I’m contradicting myself but don’t get me wrong relationships are very important in life but don’t build yourself wealth on the way people treat you because they are or may (fingers crossed) disappoint you. People are dynamic creatures, they can change their mind-set and their attitude towards you and that shouldn’t determine your outlook on life. This time has given me time to observe (mostly people), when you are doing well everybody wants to be connected to you in a way (be your friend) but when you aren’t really doing anything people can disappear faster than you can say your own name.  In life at the end of the day it’s you and God. 

### * To Get in The Right State of Mind

 Us I write this most of my friends and classmates are in level 200 going to 300. Most of them are currently even doing internships during the summer but do I regret this time of No…not at all. It’s given me time to work on me basically get my mind on the right track. I know for a fact that if I was in school by now I’ll just be the same old me, the person who doesn’t want to be there. The guy who just goes with the flow and doesn’t really do anything (You don’t know what you have till it’s gone). But now I kind of know what I want from school. I have rekindled the burning flame in my life to strive for more. I don’t want to sound to cliché but my mind-set us a person has changed for the better (well at least I hope…let’s keep our fingers crossed). “You can’t build a great Building on a weak foundation” - Gordon B Hinckley

### * Not just follow the pattern of life (The rat race)

  Another reason I would advise someone to take a gap year is to gain a different perspective on life. I think every once in a while it’s good to take a step back and see where you are actually heading. Sometimes the noise around you doesn’t create the right environment to revaluate one’s self to make the right choices. What’s next after school ----- > work (your career) and most of my age mates wouldn’t get another chance in their life to just basically take life slowly. I have learnt a lot of lessons about myself and life in general with this time off and instead of just following the crowd I know this time off has really helped me overall.


### * The is a time for everything under the sun

 Looking back at when I was in boarding school, I vividly remember that I had a book counting the number of days left till I had finished prison (graduated) and back then it never seemed like it would have ever ended. It was an ongoing cycle of going to school for a term, then coming home for a vacation that always seemed to have ended in less than an hour, then going back to school. Looking back now I have noticed everything comes to an end, even life. Nothing last forever in life, so try and use your time wisely. So when you have to do something you don’t like just do it (like Nike says). It will eventually pass, its not going to be forever. 

### * Always be humble

 This is not merely a lesson I had to learn but it just reminded me that always be humble in life. My auntie always says that don’t be stupid in life course if you end up killing yourself, yes we would cry for you but it will only be for some days maybe even months but at the end of the day we would stop crying and move on with our lives . Life will go on whether or not you decide to do something with yourself. Even when a president dies his vice is inaugurated that same day (the world doesn’t revolve around one single person). Just because you don’t want to be doing something (aren’t in school or bettering yourself) doesn’t mean the world (your friends) or time will stop for you, people will continue chasing their dreams. Everybody is the main character of their story.
